Description: Package for learning and evaluating (subgroup) policies via doubly robust loss functions. Policy learning methods include doubly robust blip/conditional average treatment effect learning and sequential policy tree learning. Methods for (subgroup) policy evaluation include doubly robust cross-fitting and online estimation/sequential validation. See Nordland and Holst (2022) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2212.02335> for documentation and references.
